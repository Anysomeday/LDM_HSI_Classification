The India Pines scene was gathered by the AVIRIS sensor over the India Pine test site in North-western Indiana, USA and consists of $145\times145$ pixels and 220 spectral reflectance bands in the wavelength range of [0.4$\mu$m,2.5$\mu$m]. It contains two-thirds agriculture, and one-third forest or other natural perennial vegetation. There are two major dual lane highways, a rail line, as well as some low density housing, other built structures, and smaller roads. Some of the crops, {\em e.g.}, corn, soybeans, are in early stages of growth with less than 5\% coverage. The available ground truth is designated into 16 classes shown in Fig. \ref{INDIA} and is not all mutually exclusive. Twenty water absorption bands are removed before experiments: [104,108], [150,163], and 220.
